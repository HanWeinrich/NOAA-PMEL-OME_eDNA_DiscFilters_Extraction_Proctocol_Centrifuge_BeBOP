## BACKGROUND

This document describes the required protocol to extract DNA from a 47 mm disc filter with a 0.22 µm pore size used with vacuum filtration or from the [Smith-Root self-preserving eDNA filter](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/2041-210X.13212).

### Summary

Nucleic acid extraction from disc filters using the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit with some modifications to the manufacturer’s protocol. These extraction protocols, adapted from [Spens et al 2017](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12683) and additionally modified for use with disc filters, are used by the NOAA PMEL Ocean Molecular Ecology (OME) Group.


### Method Description and Rationale

The [Spens et al 2017](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12683) protocol is a widely used, highly reproducible, and easily executable DNA extraction protocol from Sterivex capsule filters. This protocol has been adapted for use with 47 mm disc filters and is used by the [PMEL Ocean Molecular Ecology Program](https://www.pmel.noaa.gov/ocean-molecular-ecology/).


### Spatial Coverage and Environment(s) of Relevance

This protocol has been used to extract DNA from thousands of filtered seawater samples taken from coastal stations off the western coast of North America in the Northeastern Pacific Ocean, Bering Sea, and Arctic Ocean (primarily off California, Oregon, Washington, and Alaska), as well as freshwater samples from Lake Washington. Samples collected range in depth from surface ocean (epipelagic biome) to just off bottom (benthic biome) at varying distances from shore (coastal to off-shelf).

### Personnel Required

One person with molecular biology experience.

### Safety

Buffer AW1 from the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit contains guanidine hydrochloride and is classified as category 4 for acute toxicity [(Safety Data Sheet)](https://www.qiagen.com/binary/resource/sds/800000000214-en-GB-IE--1/214-BufferAW1-en-GB-IE--1.00000.pdf). Additional care should be taken when working with this buffer. For other reagents, standard precautions, including wearing PPE, should be taken to avoid skin and eye exposure to chemicals.

### Training Requirements

Molecular biology training (including, at a minimum, sterile technique, pipetting small volumes, and previous DNA/RNA extraction experience) is required to conduct this protocol.

### Time Required to Execute the Procedure

Extracting DNA from 24 disc filter samples, including a field or extraction blank, takes 8 hours (480 minutes), including incubation time.

## STANDARD OPERATING PROCEDURE

#### Preparation

To minimize the risk of sample contamination, this protocol should be carried out in dedicated eDNA extraction laboratories/rooms. When possible, the full dedicated lab space should be sterilized with UV.

### Before DNA Extraction

1. Run UV light for 30 minutes in the BioSafety II cabinet (BSC) and room, if not run since last use.
2. Sterilize workspaces and durable equipment, including pipettes and forceps within the BSC, with 10% bleach. Then wipe down all surfaces and equipment with 70% EtOH. If you have a UV crosslinker available, UV pipettes and tube racks regularly for 2 minutes. If using forceps, sterilize by dipping in EtOH and flaming.
4. Set up two 4-way tube racks for 5 mL tubes within the BSC, then turn on the UV light for 30 minutes to sterilize.
5. Turn on the heatshaker to 56°C. If the Buffer ATL has precipitate, place it in a heatshaker. Allow the buffer to heat until all precipitate is gone (~15 minutes), swirl as needed.
6. Aliquot ~25 mL of 100% EtOH into a 50 mL Falcon tube and store at -20°C freezer for later use.
7. Ensure 100% molecular grade EtOH has been added to Buffer AW1 and AW2 according to the Qiagen DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit manufacturer's instructions. 
8. Aliquot EtOH into a separate 50 mL Falcon tube for burning during forceps sterilization.

**Recommended (not required)**: Aliquot Buffer AW1 and AW2 into 50 mL Falcon tubes to reduce contamination caused by repeated use of large volume bottles.

### DNA Extraction

#### Before beginning, review the three options for starting filter type and condition, and decide which option fits your filters. Read carefully to determine which steps apply to your filter extraction, as some steps only apply to a certain filter type/storage condition. 

**Option A:** The filter is stored in a 5 mL or other tube containing EtOH and stored in a freezer.
**Option B:** The filter is stored in a 5 mL or other tube that does not contain EtOH and is stored in a freezer.
**Option C:** The sample was collected and stored in a Smith-Root self-preserving eDNA filter.

1AB. (*Option A & B only*) Pull samples out of the freezer and allow them to thaw for 5-10 minutes.

1C. (*Option C only*) Remove the Smith-Root filter from its bag and carefully open (white rubber side up).

2C. (*Option C only*) Using sterilized forceps, carefully remove the disc filter from the Smith-Root, ensuring that you do not also accidentally grab the paper backing filter. 

2A. (*Option A only*) If the filter is in a 5 mL or other tube containing ethanol (even residual), carefully remove the filter from the EtOH tube using sterilized forceps. Re-sterilize forceps between each sample.

3AC. (*Option A & C only*) Place the filter into an empty, pre-labeled 5 mL tube and set aside with the tube cap open (*option A*) to allow the filter to air dry while you complete this process for all samples. If Smith-Root filters (*option C*), tube caps can be closed as filters are already dry. 

4A. (*Option A only*) Spin down the tube containing the remaining EtOH for 30 mins at 6,000 x g to create a pellet. Carefully remove the excess EtOH on top of the pellet (do not disturb the pellet) with a 1000 μL pipette and discard.

5A. (*Option A only*) Carefully add pre-heated 720 µL ATL Buffer to the pellet left behind after EtOH is removed from the 5 mL tube and pipette up and down to disperse the pellet. Transfer the ATL + pellet to your 5mL tube containing the filter.

1BC. (*Option B & C only*) If the sample is in a 5 mL or other tube that does not contain EtOH or any liquid preservative, open the tube and carefully add pre-heated 720 µL ATL Buffer to the dry filter. If the filter is wet, open the tube and allow it to dry for ~30 mins.

*From this point on, all three options A, B & C are treated the same way*

5. Add 80 µL proteinase K to the filter using a sterile  200 µL filter tip, then set aside the pipette with the used tip still attached, taking care not to let the tip touch anything. 
6. Close and vortex the tube for 5-10 seconds.
7. With the same 200 µL pipette tip, push and scrunch the filter down until it is fully submerged in the buffer.
8. Incubate, while shaking at 600 rpm, at 56°C for 2-3 hours. Vortex 5 mL tubes every 30-40 minutes. If the filter rises above the reagent level, use a new 1000 µL tip to scrunch it back down before returning to the heatshaker. 
9. Once all samples are removed from the BSC and inside the heatshaker, wipe down work surfaces with 10% bleach followed by 70% EtOH. Run the UV light inside the BSC for 30 minutes before the samples are finished incubating. 
**Note**: This is a good time to pre-label your 5 mL tubes, spin columns, 1.5 mL snap cap, and 1.5 mL gasketed tubes for the next steps. Ensure that all intermediate sample containers (i.e., spin columns, 5 mL tubes) are labeled with at least the sample number on the top. Set out two 4-way tube racks to hold the 5 mL tubes during the next sample steps.
10. After 2-3 hours, remove samples from the heatshaker and vortex vigorously. 
11. Using a 1000 µL tip, remove ALL the liquid from each 5 mL tube and transfer to a new LoBind 5 mL tube. Dispose of the  filter and the old tube. If there is a pellet, avoid it as it will clog the spin column. Angle the tip to avoid the pellet.
12. Use marks on the 5 mL tube to estimate sample volume. Record these values in the eDNA notebook - helpful to record on a sticky note stuck to the BSC while measuring and then transferring to the notebook.
13. Add Buffer AL and ice-cold 100% EtOH (i.e., aliquot you stored in the -20°C freezer) to the sample in equal volumes. Sample:Buffer:Ethanol = 1:1:1. Vortex vigorously for 10-15 seconds.
14. Pipette the mixture (max 650 µL) into a spin column in a 2 mL collection tube provided by the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit. Repeat for all samples.
15. Spin in the centrifuge at 6000 ∗ g for 1 min. Discard flow-through. Tap collection tubes on a kimwipe to remove droplets before replacing the column in the collection tube.
16. Repeat steps 14-15 until the full sample volume is filtered through each spin column (takes 4-5x).
17. Move Buffer AE to the heatshaker set at 56°C to preheat for final elution. The shaking function should be turned off. 
18. Place the spin column in a new 2 ml collection tube, add 500 µl Buffer AW1, and centrifuge for 1 min at 6000 ∗ g. 
19. Discard flow-through and collection tube. Place the spin column in a new 2 ml collection tube, add 500 µl Buffer AW2, and centrifuge for 3.5 min at 20,000 ∗ g. 

**Note**: If there is liquid between the spin column and the collection tube, or if the membrane touches the filtrate, move to a new collection tube and respin the sample. Record in lab notebook.

17. Discard the flow-through and collection tube. Transfer the spin column to a new, labeled 1.5 mL tube with the cap open.
18. Add 50 µl pre-heated Buffer AE onto the spin column membrane. Incubate at room temperature for 5 min and then centrifuge for 1 min at 6,000 ∗ g. **Without** discarding flow-through, repeat with another 50 µl Buffer AE and centrifuge. Discard the spin column, as your extract is now in the 1.5 mL tube.
19. Place extracted DNA tubes into a labeled cryobox and store in a -20°C freezer until later use. Preferably, set aside an aliquot for long-term and backup storage to be archived in a -80°C freezer (see quality control for more information)

**Note:** Tubes containing DNA aliquots should be labeled on both the top and side with at least the sample number. OME also labels the sides of storage tubes with the cruise number and date of extraction. 

### Quality Control

A negative control (field blank or extraction blank) is included in every 24 set of extractions (i.e., 23 samples + NC). Samples and controls are quantified to verify DNA concentration using the [NOAA-PMEL-OME-Qubit-Quantification-Protocol-BeBOP](https://github.com/HanWeinrich/NOAA-PMEL-OME-Qubit-Quantification-Protocol-BeBOP/blob/main/NOAA-PMEL-OME-Qubit-Quantification-Protocol-BeBOP.md). Lastly, samples are PCR amplified alongside no template and positive controls.

**Recommended (not required):** OME splits all DNA extracts into three aliquots: a working stock for immediate use at -20°C (~20-30 µl) in a 1.5 mL tube; a backup stock at -20°C in case the working stock is finished or contaminated (~30-40 μL) in a 1.5 mL tube; and an archival stock in a 1.5 mL gasketed cryotube and frozen at -80°C indefinitely (~40 µl). All are stored in labeled cryoboxes.

### Basic Troubleshooting Guide

**Issue 1:** Column clogging when pipetting the sample/Buffer AL/EtOH mixture to the spin columns.

**Solution:** If a sample is turbid, solids may survive the digestion and lysis steps. These solids can clog the spin column and trap liquid above the filter. If repeating the spin-down step does not fully drain liquid from the column, use a second fresh column for the remainder of the sample. Both spin columns are then run through the protocol, and the eluted DNA is combined.

**Issue 2:** Liquid on sides of collection tube after centrifuge step following Buffer AW2 addition.

**Solution 2:** Re-run the spin-down step in a fresh spin column. No additional buffer AW2 is added. If the issue persists, move to a new collection tube and respin.

Record troubleshooting notes and issues in the lab notebook.
